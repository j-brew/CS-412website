                <h2>History of The Junior Jazz Foundation</h2>

                <p class="p2">During the past 15 years, due to the vision and foresight of 
                    Bob Masteller, The Jazz Corner has built both a tradition and
                    a reputation as one of the premier Jazz Clubs in the world. 
                    Many peers, such as Bucky Pizzarelli, George Shearing, Warren
                    and Allan Vache, and many other international artists, have 
                    rated it as the top club in the United States. Parallel with 
                    this evolution has been Masteller’s passion to pass on the 
                    legacy of Jazz to succeeding generations. Hence, the Junior 
                    Jazz Foundation was formed in 2006.</p>
                <p class="p2">The Junior Jazz Foundation (JJF) is the philanthropic 
                    outreach of The Jazz Corner and is a 501-3C non-profit 
                    organization with an independent Board of Directors who provide
                    oversight to all of the policies and By Laws of the 
                    Foundation</p>
                
                <h3>Our approach to accomplishing this is Twofold:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>To utilize The Junior Jazz Foundation to seek donations 
                        of goods and services; to raise funds for new 
                        equipment, instruments, schools, workshops, master-classes 
                        and programs which enhance the arts learning 
                        environment.</li>
                    <li>To attract, promote, and present quality jazz throughout 
                        the area through collaboration with organizations and 
                        individuals dedicated to the proliferation of the Great 
                        American Art Form of Jazz through both performance and 
                        fundraising for educational programs.</li>
                </ul>
